Notes:
Heuristic is additional info/rules/constraints which inform what would otherwise be a brute-force algorithm.
A* search algorithm checks all options and prioritise those that minimise the distance.

Need to keep all neccecary info to succeed.

Adversarial Search algorithms:
Mini-max algorithm (max chances of you winning and min chances of oponent winning)

Bayes Theory to solve Month Hall problem P(a|b)=P(b|a)*P(a)/p(b)


States (info) to store:
Only things that are neccessary to know to complete the task.
Goal state:
States that represent the goal you want to achieve.

Preception:
Sensing properties of environment

Actions:
Change state of the environment

Cognition:
Decising what actions to take based on percieved inputs.

Intelligent agent: takes actions to max expected utility given a goal (rational behavior).
	Cant expect to always operate optimally in real life. Instead, use bounded optimality.

Reactive/Behaviour based agents: Actions and Perception are directly links


Environment:
Fully/Partially observable
Determinstic/Stochastic
Discrete/Continous
Benign/Adversarial
