Constraint satisfaction problems (CSP):
Variables, domains, constraints

Constraint graphs:
Nodes are variables and lines are constraints.

Search in csp's: assign guesses to variable values to get to next state untill all have a valid value. If not then go back and repeat.
	Depth first search will get all possibilities but will test some that dont make sense and also test the same option more than once.
	Backtracking is the same as depth first search but looks at one assignment order and reverts to a different one
		once any of its constraints are violated.
		Choice of which var to choose first and what value to use affects efficiency.
	Local searches use complete assignments. All variables always are given a value. Start with full assignment then 
	change one or more variables in a local neighbourhood.
Can improve efficiency:
	Fist assign those with min remaining values (mrv).
	First assin those with most constraints.
	Forward checking keeps list of possible values left for each variable. When a variable ends up with no remaining values
	then can backtrack sooner.
		Networks are arc consistent is for each possibility in a given node, there are other viable possibilies
		which can be taken in the nodes connected to it. Network is consistent if all arc are arc consistent.

Monolithic constraints vs splitting constraints up.
All boolean constraints vs pseudo-boolean cardinality constraint.
