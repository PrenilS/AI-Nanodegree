Propositional logic:
Prop logic sentence is true or falls wrt a model of the world.
Model is true/false values for the world:{E:True, B:False...}

Truth tables:
Show the possible value of each variable (true/false usually) 
in the model and how the relate to each other by showing the values
of different sentences involving them.

Implies in prop logic can have things which arent related and still say true
so as long as both are true then true=>true is true.

Example:
	E-earthquake
	B-burglary
	A-alarm
	M/J-M or J calling
(E v B)>A so E OR B is true implies A is true
A>(J^M) A is true implies that M AND J both call
J<>M for if and only if
J<>-,M if one then not the other
E=>A is T when both are T or F and when E is F and A is T
it is only F when E is T and A is F.

Valid sentence:
True in every possible model

Satisfiable sentence:
True in some models

Limitations:
-Can only handle T/F not uncertainty
-Cant talk about objects with properties or their relations
-No shortcuts there is no all to say 100 things are T needs 100 conjunctions.

=======================================================================
#Ontological commitment: What they say about the world
*Epistemological commitment: Beliefs that agent can have


First order logic
#Relations, objects, functions
*T/F/?

Propositional logic
#Facts
*T/F/?

Probability theory
#Facts
*[0,1]

Problem solving is atomic, its broken down into bits or states and we know certain things about those states

Prop logic and Prob theory are AB factored since representation of the world is factored into certain variables

First ordered logic is structured. It has the variables but also relationships between them.
=======================================================================

First Order Logic:
Model:
-Objects
-Constants refering to objecs but doesnt have to have 1-to-1 correspondence 
-Functions
-Relations

Syntax:
-Sentences: Describe facts
	Predicates corresponding to relations so vowel(A) and equality is in every model 
	Can be combined with operators and ^, or V, not -. , implies =>, equivalent <=> and brackets
	Quantifiers: All and there exists

-Terms: Describe objects
	Constants
	Variables
	Functions
