Constraint propogation & Search

Constraint propogation narrows possibilities and means that you need to search less.
Search to find all posibilities at each step and keep track of them.

Search tries a number of possible solutions when it is not clear which solution is the correct one to use.
It branches solutions out until it finds one that works.

Depth frist search:
In tree of possibilities, start at root and move over all nodes in the left most branch then move to the next branch on the right.
