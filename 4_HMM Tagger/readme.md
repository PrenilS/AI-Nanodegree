## HMM Tagger project

This repository contains the notebooks and data used in project 4 of the Udacity AI Nanodegree program.
The main notebook is [here](HMM Tagger.ipynb). It builds a hidden Markov model (HMM) to tag parts of speech. In order to do this, the [Pomegranate](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate) library is used.

Credit for the code in this notebook must go to team at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).
Code segments provided and worked on by me are those which have **'IMPLEMENTATION'** in the header.

## Data

The data used for this part of speech project comes from the [Brown corpus](brown-universal.txt) and uses a [universal tag set](tags-universal.txt).
